### SmartTrafficControl
*Purpose*: 

The main purpose of designing the computer vision traffic control system is to enable smart decision making, based on vehicle and pedestrian density. The edge-based computer vision will be able to count the vehicles on the intersection and prioritize the traffic lane with higher vehicle density, the ON time of certain light is also defined by vehicle and pedestrian density. There will also a special case implemented during emergency vehicles. The algorithm will be overridden, whenever the emergency vehicle approaches in a certain lane the algorithm allow a continuous flow of traffic through that lane until the emergency vehicle passes.
